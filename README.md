# A New Reader

An Android client for RSS reader services with Google Reader-like apis. Currently only works for
[The Old Reader](http://theoldreader.com), but support for [InoReader](https://inoreader.com)
should not be too difficult.

## Dependencies

Uses the ActionBar-PullToRefresh library found
[here](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh).
